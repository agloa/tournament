The tournament administration system currently has two sub-systems. The [registration](/Tournament-Administration-System/Registration-System) system is a CiviCRM.org extension integrated into the AGLOA.org WordPress site. The [scoring](/Tournament-Administration-System/Scoring-System) system is a Microsoft Access database with a .NET desktop front end.
<p>Now that all tournament sites have reliable internet access, it's time to move the [scoring](/Tournament-Administration-System/Scoring-System) system into the [registration](/Tournament-Administration-System/Registration-System) system.
