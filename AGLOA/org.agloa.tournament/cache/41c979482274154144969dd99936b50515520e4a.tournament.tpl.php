                  <td>The AGLOA Board of Directors and Tournament Council wish to invite your qualified players and coaches to the 2016 Academic Games National Tournament, April 22-25, 2016, at the Marriott Marquis Hotel and Convention Center in Atlanta, Georgia.


	&nbsp;Each person (student or teacher/coach) who attends the Tournament as a player or coach pays the Tournament Registration fee of $110.&nbsp; Accompanying parents or other adults pay NO (Zero) Registration Fee.&nbsp; All players and coaches must stay at the Marriott Marquis.
	Sleeping rooms are $144 per room per night, with up to four people staying in a room.&nbsp; Individuals or Schools MUST book their own rooms through the Marriott directly (from the AGLOA block of rooms).&nbsp; There will be a dedicated web site to reserve your rooms and we have enough rooms reserved this year for all attendees.&nbsp;Your group may choose to stay either three nights or four nights or more. More information will come on that later.
	All players and coaches have the OPTION of taking the meal plan (Nine high-quality meals for $155) OR paying a facilities fee of $25 instead of taking the meal plan.&nbsp; Other adults may choose whether to take the meal plan or not. To aid in that decision, follow this link to the 2016 menu.&nbsp;&nbsp;


The completed Cost Sheet will be distributed in January 2016.

A complete Tournament Administrative Booklet and other information will be emailed in mid-April or before.&nbsp; If you have any questions, please contact me at (313) 595-7560 or Rod.Beard@agloa.org.

We are excited about the 2016 Tournament and look forward to having you join us!

In education,
